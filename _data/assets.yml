  notes: "Choice of red color is not well motivated, it was just a chance to send a string as an OpenSCAD parameter.  This color is _NOT_ carried through to the STL viewer, because OpenSCAD STLs do not carry color information.  Since models are zoomed, you can't see the size difference either.  Whoops."
